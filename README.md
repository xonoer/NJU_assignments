# NJU_assignment

### What is it?

This repository includes the assignments of multiple courses that were taken by me during my undergraduate year in Nanjing University. 

### Why is it?

The assignments have witnessed my study routes for college years, and have deep meanings for my entire life. Also, these assignment can serve as references for peer students to enhance their major knowledge and refine themselves.

### What are included?

All assignments that are **original, relatively open, and somewhat creative and interesting** are included. Apart from courses that are related to CS, many other courses like English, Maths and so on will also be in.

### What should I do when I want to take the resources here as references?

These resources are already marked by professors and TAs and all the courses listed here has been completed, which means I have got a final score (and not yet decided to retaken those). So feel free to use them as references as you like. (If you wanna acknowledge, I will be glad)
